## Check Internet Connection

The first thing you need to make sure of is your internet connection. This connection can be wired or wireless, but keep in mind: "If you don't have a stable Internet connection, don't proceed any further."

You can check the internet connection status using one of the methods below. If you have a wired connection, there is a high chance that your system connection would be established without any problems, and all you need to do is to use the `ping` command to ensure the connection is stable.

1. Use ping command:

   ```shell
   ping google.com
   ```

   If the ping command shows that your connection is stable, then you can proceed to [Set system time zone](#set-system-time-zone). Otherwise, there are two possibilities: you have a wireless connection that needs to be configured, or your wired connection has some problems that you have to troubleshoot. If you have a wireless connection, you can continue with the rest of the guide in this section to establish your system's internet connection.

2. Check internet adaptor status:

   ```shell
   ip addr show
   ```

   This command shows the status of your internet adapters and their IP addresses. If you have a wired connection, the connection will be established automatically. If you have Wi-Fi, follow these steps to connect to Wi-Fi:

   1. First, open the Internet wireless control utility using this command:

      ```shell
      iwctl
      ```

   2. Now you can list your Wi-Fi adapters:

      ```shell
      device list
      ```

      If you can't see your Wi-Fi adapter, try to fix it before proceeding. Donâ€™t proceed with installing Arch without an internet connection.

      Note: In some cases after running the previous command, your Wi-Fi adapter might be listed as "powered off." If you encounter this situation, exit the Internet wireless control utility by pressing "Ctrl + D" and then follow these steps. Otherwise, proceed to the third step for establishing the Wi-Fi connection:

      1. Use `journalctl` to check the systemd's logs to check the reason for the Wi-Fi adapter not working:

         ```shell
         journalctl | grep <adaptor name>
         ```

      2. If the output shows "Operation not possible due to RF-kill", then run this command to solve the problem:

         ```shell
         rfkill unblock all
         ```

      3. Now get back into the Internet wireless control utility and list the adapters:

         ```shell
         iwctl
         ```

         ```shell
         device list
         ```

      As you can see now, the Wi-Fi adapter has been "powered on."

      ![Image Alt Text](./images/20221122001118.png)

      Now you can proceed with the next step to connect to Wi-Fi.

   3. Establish Wi-Fi connection:

      After getting the list of wireless adapters, write down the name of the adapter listed in the previous command's result because we'll need that name to establish the connection.

      You can follow these steps to establish the Wi-Fi connection:

      1. Scan for available Wi-Fi signals:

         ```shell
         station <adaptor name> scan
         ```

      2. List the available wireless connections:

         ```shell
         station <adaptor name> get-networks
         ```

      3. Start the connection process:

         ```shell
         station <adaptor name> connect <wireless connection name>
         ```

         After running this command, you'll be prompted for the connection password. After entering the password, wait 20 to 30 seconds for the connection to stabilize, then use `Ctrl + D` to exit `iwctl`.

         Now if you run the adapter list command again, you can see that your Wi-Fi adapter is up and has an IP address. Alternatively, you can run a `ping` command to check your internet connection:

         ```shell
         ip addr show
         ```

         ```shell
         ping -c 5 google.com
         ```

## Set System Time Zone

To set the system time zone, follow these steps:

1. Enable automatic time synchronization by running the following command:

   ```shell
   timedatectl set-ntp true
   ```

   This command enables Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization, ensuring that your system clock stays accurate by syncing with internet time servers.

2. Set the desired time zone. For example, to set the time zone to Asia/Tehran, run:

   ```shell
   timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Tehran
   ```

   Replace `Asia/Tehran` with your preferred time zone from the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).

## Partition Management

### Formatting and Configuring Main Drive Partition

First, identify the name of your main drive partition by running the following command:

```shell
fdisk -l
```

Note down the name of the drive you want to use, for example, "/dev/sda".

Now, open the disk manager for the chosen storage drive:

```shell
fdisk /dev/sda
```

Follow these steps for a clean installation:

### Create New GPT Partition Table

Type `g` to create a new GPT partition table.

### Create Boot Partition

Type `n` to start creating a new partition.

1. Accept the default partition number by pressing Enter.
2. Accept the default partition start sector by pressing Enter.
3. Enter `+500M` for the size of the EFI boot partition.
4. After creating the partition, set its type:
   1. Type `t`.
   2. Enter `1` as the partition type.

### Create Swap Partition

Repeat the steps for creating a new partition.

1. Accept the default partition number and start sector.
2. Enter `+8GB` for the swap partition size.
3. Set the partition type:
   1. Type `t`.
   2. Enter `19` as the partition type.

### Create Root Partition

Repeat the steps for creating a new partition.

1. Accept the default partition number and start sector.
2. Accept the default size to use the remaining space on the disk.
3. Set the partition type:
   1. Type `t`.
   2. Enter `23` as the partition type.

### Write New Partition Table to Disk

Type `p` to see the newly created partition table info. Then type `w` to write changes to the disk.

### Format Partitions and Configure Swap

Before proceeding with the installation, it's crucial to format the partitions correctly and configure the swap partition for optimal system performance. Follow these steps to format the partitions and configure the swap partition:

1. Format EFI Boot Partition:

   Format the EFI boot partition (usually `/dev/sda1`) with the FAT32 file system to make it compatible with UEFI firmware:

   ```shell
   mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
   ```

   This command formats the partition with FAT32, making it suitable for storing EFI boot files.

2. Configure Swap Partition:

   Configure the swap partition (usually `/dev/sda2`) to be used as swap space, which provides additional virtual memory when physical RAM is fully utilized:

   ```shell
   mkswap /dev/sda2
   swapon /dev/sda2
   ```

   - `mkswap /dev/sda2`: This command sets up the swap space on the specified partition.
   - `swapon /dev/sda2`: This command activates the swap space, making it available for use by the system.

3. Format Root Partition with Btrfs:

   Format the root partition (usually `/dev/sda3`) with the Btrfs file system, which offers features like snapshots, compression, and integrated RAID support:

   ```shell
   mkfs.btrfs -n 32k /dev/sda3
   ```

   - `mkfs.btrfs -n 32k /dev/sda3`: This command formats the partition with Btrfs and specifies a node size of 32KB for metadata. Btrfs is a modern file system that provides advanced features for managing data efficiently.

Ensure to replace `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sda2`, and `/dev/sda3` with the correct partition names corresponding to your system setup.

These commands prepare the partitions for installation and ensure proper utilization of disk space and system resources.

### Create Btrfs Subvolumes

Mount the root partition to the system:

```shell
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
```

Now, create subvolumes for Btrfs:

```shell
btrfs su cr /mnt/@
btrfs su cr /mnt/@home
btrfs su cr /mnt/@var
btrfs su cr /mnt/@opt
btrfs su cr /mnt/@tmp
btrfs su cr /mnt/@.snapshots
```

Unmount the root partition:

```shell
umount /mnt
```

Mount the subvolumes:

```shell
mount -o noatime,commit=120,compress=zstd,subvol=@ /dev/sda3 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/{boot,home,var,opt,tmp,.snapshots}
mount -o noatime,commit=120,compress=zstd,subvol=@home /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
mount -o noatime,commit=120,compress=zstd,subvol=@opt /dev/sda3 /mnt/opt
mount -o noatime,commit=120,compress=zstd,subvol=@tmp /dev/sda3 /mnt/tmp
mount -o noatime,commit=120,compress=zstd,subvol=@.snapshots /dev/sda3 /mnt/.snapshots
mount -o subvol=@var /dev/sda3 /mnt/var
```

### Mount Boot Partition

Mount the boot partition:

```shell
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```

## Installing the Base System

Before installing the base system, ensure your system keyring is up to date:

```shell
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
```

Now, install the base system by choosing the appropriate command based on your CPU version:

### Intel CPUs

```shell
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-lts linux-firmware nano intel-ucode btrfs-progs
```

### AMD CPUs

```shell
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-lts linux-firmware nano amd-ucode btrfs-progs
```

### VM CPUs

For virtual machine CPUs, use the following command:

```shell
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-lts linux-firmware nano btrfs-progs
```

## Creating fstab File

Now, we need to create an fstab file. This file tells our bootloader where to look for partitions.

```shell
 genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
 cat /mnt/etc/fstab
```

The `genfstab` command generates an fstab file based on the currently mounted filesystems. The `-U` flag uses UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) to identify the partitions.

## installing arch linux

To begin installing Arch Linux, you need to enter the Arch install environment. Use the following command to connect to the Arch root installer:

```shell
arch-chroot /mnt
```

### Setting Timezone

Set the timezone by creating a symbolic link to the desired timezone file and synchronizing the hardware clock:

```shell
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Tehran /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```

### setting system locale

You need to manually edit "locale.gen" file, and uncomment "" and any other locales that you want

Edit the `locale.gen` file to enable desired locales (Recommended: "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8"), generate the locales, and set the system locale:

```shell
nano /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 >> /etc/locale.conf
```

### network configuration

Set the hostname and edit the hosts file to configure network settings:

```shell
echo archlinux >> /etc/hostname
nano /etc/hosts
```

Add the following lines to the end of the hosts file:

```plaintext
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1         localhost
127.0.1.1   myhostname.localdomain myho:stname
```
