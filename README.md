# Arch Linux Installation and Customization Guide

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for installing Arch Linux. Additionally, it includes instructions for installing EndeavourOS, a user-friendly Arch-based distribution, and customizing it as well.

Note1: During the installation process of both Arch Linux and EndeavourOS, you will be prompted to choose your preferred desktop environment (DE). In this guide, we will proceed with the installation assuming KDE Plasma as the chosen DE. However, feel free to select the DE of your choice during the installation process according to your preferences.
